        <h2> PayPal enablensfer of digital currencies to external wallets</h2>
        <img src="news1.png" alt="newsimage" width="1000px">
        <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;align-content: normal;"> The move comes after nearly two years since 
            PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.
            After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 
            2020, PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive
             digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, 
             the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible 
             U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
            BTC $16,704, Ether  ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.  
            In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout 
            at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York 
            Department of Financial Services for the conduct.</p>
            <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;"> Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and
                 enter the crypto section of the application to start transferring coins.
                 Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the procedure.</p>
                 <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;">
                    Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based 
                    on their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur 
                    such fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for 
                    each transaction 
                    into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming transfers,
                    The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as 
                    central bank digital currencies, 
                    to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own 
                    stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of
                     such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app.
