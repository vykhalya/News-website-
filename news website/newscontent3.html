                 <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;">
                    In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy 
                    clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired

                        The Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began accumulating the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC. “Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.
Saylor said in an interview last week:

                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;">
                            The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the
                             institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a 
                            digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;">
                                The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of the
                                 Commodity Futures Trading
                                 Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;content: normal;">
                                    Saylor previously explained that Microstrategy is investing in BTC “for the 
                                    long term.” He added: “Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, 
                                    so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. 
                                    So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”
