                The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading platform.

                <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;align-content: normal;">Eisenberg faces charges of
                     commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing unsealed Tuesday.
                      The charges could see 
                    punishments ranging from fines to prison time.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;align-content: normal;">A deposition signed by
                         FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and knowingly” manipulated 
                         the sale of a
                         commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.</p>
                         <p style="font-size: x-large;color: black;align-content: normal;">“Eisenberg engaged in a
                             scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation 
                            of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called 
                            Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”
